IMPORTANT: Make sure you add the shader graph package to your project

The main shader "SpaceCloudWave" is for generating an abstract wave like effect. It has layers for diffuse, a parallax normal map, and vertex oscillation.

To use, create a material and apply the "Shader Graphs/SpaceCloudWaves" shader. Then play with the values as you see fit!

The intended use is on a terrain object but can be used on any mesh. 


Shader Properties:

Diffuse: Main Texture and Color

Parallax: A texture that looks farther away and warped as the waves move around

Highlight: Higher surfaces that glow at the right angles

Fog: The color things look as they are farther away

Transparency: Fade out at a distance

Vertex Offset: How the model moves over time
